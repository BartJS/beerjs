# beerjs Trondheim

BeerJS in Trondheim is an initiative from [BeerJS](https://github.com/beerjs).
***
The idea of BeerJS is quite simple. JavaScript interested groups up, takes a beer or two, or three, and discuss JavaScript or something completely different together with likeminded people! From experience, it will be a good atmosphere when several developers groups up under the same roof. It will be room to have open conversations without one having to be quite-so formal. Though one is having a blast, it is still limits, of which you can find [Here](https://github.com/BartJS/organisering/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md).

We use Github Issues/Slack to discuss upcoming meetups, and you are happily welcomed to submit any proposals. That would be for example what types of meetups we will have.

If you are looking for international conrads from BeerJS, you can find them on [Slack](https://beerjs-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

##Organizing

We publish our meetup plans here, on Github, under `/meetups` where you will find information. We are not on Slack under BeerJS, but we are labeled as [BartJS](https://chat.bartjs.io/).

##Are you interested in participating?

Interested in joining one of our meetups?

1. Go to Issue tracker, press `New issue`.

2. Write your name, together with where we can reach out to you. Optimally, we just want your email, so you don't have to publish sensitive information online.

3. Press `Submit new issue`.

4. Done! Next thing happening, is that we contact you by email where the only requirement, will be that you are polite!


##Small reminder about BeerJS

beer.js is about socializing through meetups and to strengthen developer communities. It is not required to drink.

Cheers! :beer: :beers:
